# The Production Development Driven Manifesto

**We are lazy** and **we are programmers**.

Organization trying to build robust, resilient, flexible system but **we are lazy**.


The only very important thing of our work is to make available in production environment something that works
or at least something that seems it works.

That's all.

Other stuff like design pattern, test, best practices are only a way to slow down the process to publishing in production.

>_Remember life is short to not publish directly in production_ (says Ringo, an expert Production Development Driven guy)

_**Note:**_ If you find errrors in this manifesto it is ok, we publish it as we write without rereading it. It's PDD sty;le

## What make You a real Production Development Driven guy:

* **Publish** directly in production environment.
If you use strong typed language and your code compiles then absolutely it works, go to production.
It is also possible to publish in production if you think that it works

* **No test**, Why you need waste your time with test? Who cares???
If it works in production you don't need test, production environment is the only real test

* **VCS** (Version Control System) is **optional**.
The key is to bring things to production, it is not important have versioning of the software

* Continuos Integration is a **pain in the ass**, please avoid these systems.
You build it and you deploy it, that's all.

* 0 (zero) Yeah!! **Zero documentation**! No time wasted in writing Wiki, or comments in your code

* **No plan** to go to production,
if you feel or think that is the right moment to deploy
in production environment then publish it

* Remember, **If something doesn't work** in production you have at least these options:
  * "I didn't touch anything so it is not my fault"
  * "I am sure is a system admin problem"
  * "On my computer it works"
  * "It a feature not a bug"
